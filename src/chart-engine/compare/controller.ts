/**
 * Multi-symbol comparison: put a second instrument on the primary one's pane
 * and read them together (NIFTY against BANKNIFTY, a stock against its index).
 *
 * Headless, in the spirit of `DrawingController` (src/draw/controller.ts) and
 * `ReplayController`: it owns the series, the alignment and the scales, and
 * ships no DOM, so the host draws its own symbol chips and legend rows from
 * `list()`.
 *
 * Three decisions carry the design:
 *
 * 1. **The comparison never touches the primary's axis.** It goes on the pane's
 *    hidden overlay scale (`priceScaleId: ''`, see `Pane._scaleFor`), which
 *    autoscales on its own and draws no ticks, so a 46,000 instrument next to a
 *    22,000 one cannot compress the primary's candles or relabel its ladder.
 *
 * 2. **Comparability comes from the scale, not from the data.** The bars handed
 *    over are stored as the instrument's own prices, so the legend, the
 *    crosshair and any live update still speak in real prices. What makes the
 *    lines readable together is the pane mode: `percentage` and
 *    `indexed-to-100` give every scale its own baseline (the first *visible*
 *    bar, so panning re-bases), and `_mirror` then gives the overlay the same
 *    band of percent the primary's axis is showing. Without that mirror each
 *    scale would autoscale to its own data and a 1% mover would look exactly
 *    like a 10% mover, both filling the pane.
 *
 * 3. **Alignment is by timestamp** and lives in `./align`, which documents what
 *    happens in each direction of mismatch.
 *
 * Known limit: a pane has exactly *one* hidden overlay scale, so every
 * comparison on a pane shares one baseline. That is exactly right for one
 * comparison, which is the common case, and it is why a second comparison in
 * the same pane is quoted against the first instrument's price. Keyed overlay
 * scales in `Pane` are the fix; until then, put further instruments on their
 * own pane with `paneIndex`.
