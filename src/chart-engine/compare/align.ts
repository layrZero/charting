/**
 * Aligning a second instrument onto the primary series' bars.
 *
 * The x-axis is a gapless logical index over the times the shared DataLayer
 * holds (ARCHITECTURE.md §4.1, §5.3), so two instruments do not share a bar
 * index and cannot be laid side by side by position. They are matched by
 * timestamp, and the two directions of mismatch get opposite answers:
 *
 * - **A comparison bar with no primary bar is dropped.** The DataLayer merges
 *   *every* series' times into one index space, so a time only the comparison
 *   has would mint a new logical index: a column the primary instrument has no
 *   candle for, inserted mid-chart, shifting every bar after it. That happens
 *   for real (a different exchange's holiday calendar, a 24/7 instrument next
 *   to an NSE one, a feed that emits a stray print), and warping the primary's
 *   own axis to accommodate a comparison is never the right trade. The print is
 *   counted in `dropped` so a host can say so rather than silently losing it.
 *
 * - **A primary bar with no comparison bar becomes whitespace**, which is a NaN
 *   bar the line renderer breaks across, so the comparison shows a *gap*. The
 *   alternative, carrying the last known value forward, draws a flat segment
 *   through a session the instrument never traded and, worse, in percentage
 *   mode it anchors the move on the far side of the gap to a print that does
 *   not exist. Omitting the bar entirely is worse still: the renderer would
 *   join the two sides with one straight line across the holiday.
 *
 * Matching is on the exact timestamp. Bar-open times are bucketed by the candle
 * builder (§10.2) and stored as UTC seconds (§4.0), so two instruments on the
 * same interval agree to the second; anything that does not agree is a
 * different interval, which no tolerance window could rescue.
