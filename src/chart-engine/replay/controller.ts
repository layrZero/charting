/**
 * Market replay: walk a historical session forward bar by bar so a trader can
 * practise on it, and so every indicator redraws exactly as it stood at that

 *
 * Headless, in the spirit of `DrawingController` (src/draw/controller.ts): it
 * owns the playhead and the transitions and ships no DOM, so the host renders
 * its own transport bar, scrub slider and clock from `state()` and the events.
 *
 * The mechanic is deliberately boring. Replay feeds the chart a **prefix** of
 * the full bar array through the ordinary `series.setData` path, and that is
 * what makes indicators free: `Chart._setData` calls `_recomputeIndicators` for
 * the primary series, and `IndicatorInstance.recompute` re-reads the whole
 * history from `sourceBars()`. Shorten that history and every indicator, level,
 * fill, marker and legend reconstructs itself as it was at that bar, with no
 * replay-aware code anywhere in the indicator tier.
