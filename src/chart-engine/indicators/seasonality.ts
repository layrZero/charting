/**
 * Seasonality: a heatmap of monthly percentage changes, one row per calendar
 * year, pinned to a corner of its own pane. Part of the lazy
 * `@layr0/chart-engine/indicators` tier.
 *
 * The study answers something a curve cannot: "how has this symbol behaved in
 * October, historically?" That is a matrix keyed by month and year, not a value
 * per bar, so it comes back through the descriptor's `table` hook. The single
 * declared plot returns an all-null column: the one-column-per-plot contract
 * still has to be honoured, but the column draws nothing and is skipped by
 * autoscale, exactly as the fractal study's carrier column is.
 *
 * A month's figure is its close against the previous month's close, the same
 * one-period change the reference takes on a monthly series. Measuring only
 * from the month's own first bar would drop the gap over the turn of the month,
 * which on a gapping instrument is a large part of the move.
 *
 * Months are resolved on the chart's configured calendar, the same clock the
 * VWAP anchors run on, so a month boundary never lands on the UTC midnight seam
 * and never lands mid-afternoon in the market being charted. That calendar used
 * to be IST unconditionally, which on a US symbol put the month boundary at
 * 18:30 UTC and handed the last ninety minutes of a month-end New York session
 * to the following month.
 *
 * Unlike the VWAP and CPR frames, this one is deliberately tested bar by bar
 * rather than on session opens. Those two anchor an accumulation to a trading
 * period, which must not restart mid-session; this one attributes a close to a
 * calendar month, and a session that straddles the turn of the month genuinely
 * has bars in both.
 *
 * Two deliberate departures from the study as published:
 *   - it also draws a dashed projection box on the price pane for the month in
 *     progress, from the previous close to the price the historical average
 *     implies. This library has no box primitive, and that average is the
 *     "Avgs" row of the table, so the number itself is not lost.
 *   - its table width and height are percentages of the pane. A `table` hook
 *     cannot measure the pane it will be drawn into, so those two inputs are
 *     not offered rather than accepted and silently ignored, the same call the
 *     VWAP anchors make about the anchor kinds that need a feed we lack.
 *
 * Original implementation written from the described behaviour, per
 * ARCHITECTURE.md §0.1, not ported from any third-party source.
