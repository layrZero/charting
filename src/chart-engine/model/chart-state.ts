/**
 * Serialisable chart state — the keystone the persistence-shaped features hang
 * off (saved layouts, templates, an objects panel, favourites, drawings).
 *
 * The rule that shapes this type: **the chart serialises what the chart owns.**
 * Series *data* is the application's — it knows the symbol, the timeframe, and
 * the feed — so `restoreState` never recreates series. It restores the things
 * the chart is the source of truth for (viewport, grid, panes, price scales,
 * indicators) and reports the series it saw so an app can rebuild them itself
 * and re-apply their styling.
