/**
 * Interactive value capture (ARCHITECTURE.md §7). A settings input that names a
 * price or a time is declarative and the host renders it, but the *value* can
 * come from pointing at the chart, and only the engine knows what is under the
 * cursor. So the host arms a pick ("the user is now choosing a price"), the next
 * click on the plot answers with one, and the pick disarms itself.
 *
 * Built on the `click` event the draw tier's placement mode already resolves
 * anchors from, rather than a second capture path: same pane resolution, same
 * on-demand autoscale, same payload.
 *
 * Placement mode is deliberately *not* armed while picking. A pick wants panning
 * left alone (scroll back to the bar you mean, then click it), and a drag emits
 * no click outside placement mode, so panning cannot answer the pick by
 * accident. It also keeps a pick from cancelling an active drawing tool.
