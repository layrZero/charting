/**
 * Interval registry (ARCHITECTURE.md 10.2). A host registers its own interval
 * codes here, and the engine asks this module how a code buckets.
 *
 * The entry is a *bucketing rule*, not a duration, because three of the four
 * kinds have no duration to state:
 *   - `interval`  fixed seconds per bar, the only kind a code-to-seconds map
 *                 could ever have expressed.
 *   - `calendar`  month / quarter / year, whose length depends on which month
 *                 and which year, and whose boundaries land at local midnight
 *                 in the chart's configured zone. A month is not 30 days, a
 *                 year is not 365, and a New York month is not a Mumbai month.
 *   - `ticks`     a bar closes after N trades.
 *   - `volume`    a bar closes after N traded quantity.
 *
 * The last three are exactly the modes `TickBarAggregator` already had, so this
 * is that vocabulary widened by one case rather than a second system: the older
 * `TickTimeframe` name is still here and still means the same three modes.
 *
 * Registering nothing leaves every built-in code resolving exactly as it did
 * before this module existed. An unrecognised code is an error, not a minute.
