/**
 * Tick aggregation (ARCHITECTURE.md 10.2). Aggregates raw trade ticks into
 * bars on a chosen bucketing: clock interval, calendar period, tick count, or
 * traded volume. Incremental and deterministic, so it works live and is
 * unit-testable.
 *
 * This is the foundation for tick / volume timeframes and (with classified
 * bid/ask ticks) for the footprint aggregator. Tick-count and volume bars need
 * real trade ticks: OHLCV alone can't produce them.
 *
 * The bucketing rules themselves live in `./intervals`, which is also where a
 * host registers its own interval codes; this class just applies one.
