/**
 * Per-bar pane shading: one full-height column behind the data, in whatever
 * colour the descriptor gave that bar.
 *
 * A regime study answers "which state is the market in", and that is a property
 * of the whole bar rather than of a price. As a column it reads at a glance and
 * costs the price scale nothing, where a plot would need a value to sit at and
 * would drag the pane's autoscale around with it.
 *
 * What makes it affordable is the work skipped: everything outside the visible
 * range is dropped before anything is painted, and adjacent bars sharing a
 * colour become one rect instead of one rect each. A year of two-state shading
 * is a handful of fills, not one per bar per frame.
