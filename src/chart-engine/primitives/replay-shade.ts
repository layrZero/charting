/**
 * Dims everything from a bar onward, and draws the line where the cut falls.
 *
 * Two jobs, one shape. Picking a replay start means answering "from here, what
 * happens next?", and the honest way to ask it is to hide the answer: the bars
 * to the right of the cursor are greyed while the user chooses, so a start bar
 * is picked on what was known at the time rather than on the shape of what
 * followed. Once replay is running the same veil marks the part of the session
 * that has not been reached yet.
 *
 * The shade is drawn over the series rather than under it, because covering the
 * future is the entire point: a translucent wash still shows the shape faintly,
 * which is what tells a user there is more session there to walk into.
